Es 6
Content is being showed dynamically
Modular Approach

Folders:
"Main" : Contain the main pages like login, first page, etc
"Academics" : Options in this page are working; Improvised tabular format used by university


Rest folders are one for each tab option and have not much working content because they are all similar 
Each folder have their own HTML Pages, Css Files(stylesheets), JS files folders(scripts)

I tried to minimize dependencies between pages and make content more arranged and user friendly
