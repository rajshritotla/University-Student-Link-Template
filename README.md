# Features

Modular Approach 

Mobile Responsive

# Folders description

"Main" : Contain the main pages like login, first page, etc

"Academics" : Options in this page are working; Improvised tabular format used by university

Rest folders are one for each tab option and have not much working content because they are all similar 

```
Each folder have their own HTML Pages, Css Files(stylesheets), JS files folders(scripts)
```

I tried to minimize dependencies between pages and make content more arranged and user friendly
